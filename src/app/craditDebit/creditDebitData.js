    desp: "While many clients prefer eWallets and card payments, there are some who can only access international bank wire. Another reason to use bank wire is to take advantage of its high security protocols. In most cases, an international bank wire is routed by at least 3 banks, which may be located in different jurisdictions, using different major local currencies. We still offer this option to those clients who find it convenient, but please remember that it may take up to 7 days for the funds to reflect in your trading account.",

    desp: "Globalfx500 also accepts deposits via local bank wire. This is a cheaper alternative to international bank wire because it is peer-to-peer (The process uses people’s or institutions’ bank accounts directly). However, some banks may lack a current working relationship and may have to use intermediaries. It typically takes 3-5 business days for the funds to reflect in your trading account if you use local bank wire.",
